I have implimented a number of features whilst working on the Bunnings website, the most notable being the Team Member discount, Corperage Gift Cards and PayPal Integration features.</p><br/>
                    <p>As you can imagine the Bunnings website is absolutely huge and by far the biggest project I have worked on to date, it is actually the biggest ecommerce project in the southern hempisphere at the moment so I am now very well versed in being part of a large development team and everything that goes with that.</p><br/>
                    <p>The front end on the commerce section of the Bunnings website is all React/Redux based and I have now gained significant experience in these technologies, as well as furthing my existing front end skills and ingetrating with the back end setup (Sitecore).</p>

                    <p>During my time at The Independent and The Evening Standard my day to day responsibilities were to look after the front end of both The Independent and The Evening Standard, both sites were CMS driven using Drupal 7. My typical tasks
                        were anything from bug fixing to implementing new functionality to either site as requested by the shareholder.</p><br/>
                    <p>I was involved with a couple of excellent projects during my time here, the first being to create a landing page for users that had subscribed to The Independent daily app to offer them a free gift for renewing their yearly subscription.
                        The functionality where the user was able to select their free gift was built using javascript, with the landing page template being built using HTML and CSS and the from the user filled in using php.</p><br/>
                    <p>The second was to re-work the whole of The Standards front end. The designs were very different from the old site, as well as this we had decided to make the site more modular on the front and back end. So, this meant changing the
                        SASS and the template structuring. The templates were built using ejs, this allowed us to parse the data in using a json feed. The whole site, once finished now worked on the MVC framework structuring principle.</p>

                        The day to day tasks are typically bug fixing and adding new functionality as requested internally and from the clients. I am also heavily involved in producing applications for both web and mobile use. This is predominantly for eBay but I have worked
                        on many campaigns all the way from simple HTML email builds up to complex CMS implementation, migration and development. </p><br/>
                    <p>We also built tools used by eBay’s internal marketing team to automate a lot of their processes and gather data to aid their marketing campaigns.</p>
