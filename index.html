                    <p>My main responsibility at London Capital Group was the conversion of static HTML websites into CMS (Drupal) driven websites, completing full build from start to finish. I was responsible for the build of various microsites and email
                        campaigns for external and internal marketing teams. Again I was responsible for working on the development of the numerous internal tools used for communication between the IT support team and Development team, for example the
                        bug logging and ticketing system we used, as well as writing applications to automate different tasks performed by the support team to streamline the process as much as possible, for example the implementation of the live chat
                        functionality for communication with clients across the business. London Capital Group operates within an agile environment; working at the company for four years, this methodology is something I am well versed in having been exposed
                        to.

                    <p>I moved to The Think Tank as I was keen to work in an agency environment and enjoyed working on a number of different projects and for a number of different clients. Working in a varied role, I worked on all types of projects from
                        developing client web sites, designing HTML email templates, launching the email campaigns through Campaign Monitor and coming up with designs for Flash banners. Through this role I gained exposure to PHP and MySQL which is something
                        I enjoyed greatly and have a keen interest in server side technologies and web 2.0 technologies.</p>

                    <p>My duties consisted of working on the day to day running of the company’s website. This could be anything from bug fixing, adding new functionality or re skinning the site. The majority of the work was done on the CFEclipse IDE. The
                        main focus of my work would normally be within the XHTML, CSS, XML and XSLT languages, of which I am proficient. As well as the day-today running of the web site, I am also worked as Email Marketing Manager, creating HTML email
                        designs to specification and overseeing the sending of the email to our users on a MySQL database. I also did a lot of work with clients developing tools they used to gather data for marking purposes and automation of thier marketing
                        processes for them, this could be storing data from people that had purchased tickets for thier events and automation of simple marketing campaign targeting them for the next event the company held.</p>
